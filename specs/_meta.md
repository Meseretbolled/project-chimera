# Project Chimera — Meta Specification

## Vision
Project Chimera is an autonomous influencer infrastructure designed as a governed,
spec-driven multi-agent system.

Its purpose is to enable AI agents to:

- Research trends
- Generate content drafts
- Validate safety and compliance
- Publish through controlled approval gates

---

## Prime Directive
> No implementation code may be written unless explicitly aligned with `/specs`.

---

## System Constraints

- Specs are the single source of truth
- Agents operate only through bounded skills
- No agent has direct credential access
- Publishing requires validation + approval
- MCP Sense provides auditability

---

## Deliverable (Day 3)
A repository so well specified and tooled that agent swarms can build features safely.

Not a finished influencer bot.
